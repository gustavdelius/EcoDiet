\title{Example biotracer data}
\format{A table with 15 rows and 3 columns. Each row is an isotopic sample from one individual.
The columns are:
\describe{
  \item{group}{the trophic group the individual belonged to}
  \item{d13C}{the d13C measurement made on that individual}
  \item{d15N}{the d15N measurement made on that individual}
}}
\description{
This is an artificial and simple biotracer dataset, more specifically stable isotope analyses,
 made to illustrate the package on a simple case. All tables whose name start by "example" are describing
 different data from the same trophic groups.
