\title{Realistic biotracer data}
\format{A table with 300 rows and 3 columns. Each row is an isotopic sample from one individual, and
there are 30 individuals sampled in each trophic group.
The columns are:
\describe{
  \item{group}{the trophic group the individual belonged to}
  \item{d13C}{the d13C measurement made on that individual}
  \item{d15N}{the d15N measurement made on that individual}
}}
\description{
This is an artificial and realistic biotracer dataset, more specifically stable isotope analyses,
 made to illustrate the package on a complex dataset. All tables whose name start by "realistic" are
 describing different data from the same trophic groups.
