Title: Estimating a diet matrix from biotracer and stomach content data
Description: The goal of the package is to estimate a probabilistic topology matrix 
    (all trophic link probabilities) and a diet matrix (all diet propotions) by combining biotracers 
    and stomach content analyses in a Bayesian hierarchical model.
    The package relies on the JAGS software and the rjags package to run a Markov chain Monte Carlo 
    approximation of the different variables.
