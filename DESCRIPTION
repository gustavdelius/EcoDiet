Title: Estimating a diet matrix from isotopic and stomachal data sources
Description: The goal of the package is to estimate trophic links and a diet matrix 
    from isotopic and stomachal data using a Bayesian Hierarchical Model. The package 
    relies on the JAGS software and the rjags package to run a MCMC approximation of 
    the different variables.
