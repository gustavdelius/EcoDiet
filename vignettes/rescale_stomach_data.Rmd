If the occurrences in your stomachal data are too small, you may need to rescale them, i.e., to inrease them using the number of full stomachs as a reference. For that you can use the `rescale_stomach_data` function.

We first need to load and rearrange the data inside our example:

```{r}
library(EcoDiet)
preprocessed_data <- load_data(ecodiet_example)

```

Here are our example stomachal data, and the number of full stomachs, before rescaling them:

```{r}
preprocessed_data$o
preprocessed_data$n_sca

```

And here are the stomachal data after they have been rescaled:

```{r}
preprocessed_data$o <- rescale_stomach_data(preprocessed_data$o, preprocessed_data$n_sca)
preprocessed_data$o

```
